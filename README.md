The developed code aims to process data from CSV files sent by the bank, which correspond to transaction statements. Through this processing, the code performs the task of grouping the dates present in the files and calculating the expenses incurred on each day.

This function is especially useful for financial analysis, allowing for a clearer and organized visualization of daily expenses. Based on the grouped data, valuable insights can be obtained regarding consumption patterns, identifying spikes in expenses during specific periods, and assessing the distribution of expenses over time.

By automating this grouping and calculation process, the code simplifies the task of analyzing bank statements, making it more efficient and less prone to errors. Moreover, the code can be easily adapted to process and analyze large volumes of data, enabling its application in more complex cases or with a significant number of transactions.

This scientific approach provided by the code offers a more accurate perspective on daily expenses, allowing for more informed decision-making regarding personal or business financial management. With the use of this tool, areas for potential savings can be identified, the effectiveness of spending plans can be evaluated, and a more detailed analysis of consumption habits can be conducted.

In summary, the developed code performs the processing of bank statement data in CSV format, grouping the dates and calculating the expenses incurred on each day. This scientific approach enables a deeper and objective analysis of daily expenses, providing a better understanding of consumption patterns and informed decision-making regarding financial management.
